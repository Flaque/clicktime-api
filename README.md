# ClickTime Project

A simple interface to the ClickTime user API.

## Get started!

### Setup!

Setup is easy. If you have [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn), run:

``` $ yarn ```

If you have npm:

```$ npm install ```

I use Yarn mainly because of the offline mode. If you haven't used Yarn before, that's okay! You can generally replace `yarn` with `npm` in most of the commands.

### Launch!

To run the app, you can do either:

```$ yarn start``` or ```$ npm start ```

This will launch a browser-sync'd app in your browser at
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

### Test!

To run tests, just run either:

``` $ yarn test ``` or ```$ npm test```

You can also have them running all the time with:

``` $ yarn test-watch ``` or ``` $ npm test-watch ```

### Create!

Want to add to the project? You can create new component boilerplates with:

``` $ yarn create MyComponentName ``` or ``` $ npm create MyComponentName ```.

This will create a react/sass/jest boilerplate in the `src/components` folder.
